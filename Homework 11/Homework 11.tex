\begin{problem}{\S 10.7 - 11}
Show that $K_5$ is nonplanar using an argument similar to that given in Example 3.

Solution:
Since $K_5$ is fully connected between any pair of vertices, there must be an edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$, $v_2$ and $v_3$, $v_3$ and $v_4$, $v_1$ and $v_4$, $v_1$ and $v_3$, $v_4$ and $v_2$, which seperates the space into two spaces, and $v_2$ is inside the circuit, but $v_5$ is outside, so it is impossible to connect them without intersection with other edges.

Solution:

The chromatic number of this graph is $3$ since $a$ and $b$ are adjacent, they should have different color, $b$ and $c$ are adjacent, they should have different color, and $a$ and $c$ are adjacent, so different color. Thus, there are $3$ colors, but for $d$, since it only adjacent with $b$, it can be same color as $a$ or $c$, thus still $3$.

\draw[postaction={decorate}] (f) to (g);
\end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Solution:

The chromatic number of this graph is $3$ since $b$ and $c$ are adjacent, they should have different color, $b$ and $g$ are adjacent, they should have different color, and $c$ and $g$ are adjacent, so different color. Thus, there are $3$ colors, but for $d$, since it only adjacent with $c$ and $g$ which already assigned color, it can be same color as $b$. And for $a$, since only adjacent with $b$ and $g$ which already assigned color, it can be same color with $c$. and for $e$ since only adjacent with $a$ and $g$, it can be same as $b$, similarly, $f$ can be same color as $c$. So, in total, still $3$ colors.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\S 10.8 - 15}
What is the chromatic number of $W_n$?

Solution:

$W_n$ is a wheel graph, thus, it is forming by $C_n$ with an vertex in the center, connecting all vertex in $C_n$. Thus, the basic structure are many triangles. for one triangle planar graph, it should contain three different color in each vertex to make no adjacent have same color. And when other points afflicated on this triangle by connecting with one center vertex and a vertex on the circle, it can have the same color with the vertex on that triangle it doesn't connected with, thus, whenever adding how many vertices, it will still be $3$ colors. But, when coming to the last edge connecting the base vertex of those triangle in two sides (The red edge in the graph below). When the vertices connected by the two graph has identical color, one of them should change to another color, which will end up with $4$ different color. Thus, in case if $n$ is odd number, the chromatic number of this graph is $4$, and if $n$ is even number, the chromatic number is $3$.
\[\begin{cases}
    3 \text{ $n$ is even number}\\
    4 \text{ $n$ is odd number}
\end{cases}\]

\begin{problem}{\S 10.8 - 16}
Show that a simple graph that has a circuit with an odd
number of vertices in it cannot be colored using two colors.

Solution:

Suppose a simple graph with odd number of vertices forms a circuit. $v_1,\cdots,v_n$, where $n$ is odd number. Then, if we assign them in pair, which pair wise connected, like $v_1-v_2$, each pair should contain different color. but there will be an vertex that cannot form with other vertices to form a pair since odd number cannot divided by 2. Then, when we try to connect those pairs head to end, it will form a circuit with the last vertex has the two adjacent vertex with different color. Thus, this vertex should have different color with both vertices to meet the requirement. Thus, it cannot be colored using two colors.
