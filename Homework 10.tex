Solution:

It is cannot give a Euler Circuit, since the vertex $c$ and $f$ has degree of 3, which is not even, cannot satisfy the requirement of all even degree. The Euler path is 

\[c,b,d,c,e,a,d,e,f,b,a,f\]

\begin{problem}{\S 10.5 - 26} For which values of $n$ do these graphs have an Euler
circuit?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $K_n$
\item[(b)] $C_n$
\item[(c)] $W_n$
\item[(d)] $Q_n$
\end{enumerate}
Solution:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $K_n$ Since all vertices are connected with each other, and there are total $n$ vertices, each vertices are connected to $n-1$ vertices, so, degree is $n-1$, so, to satisfy all have even degree, the $n$ should be odd.
\item[(b)] $C_n$ This forms a circle, which each vertices have exactly degree of 2 for $n\geq 3$, which automatically satisfies all vertices have even degree, so for every $n\geq 3$, it have an Euler circuit.
\item[(c)] $W_n$ This forms a wheel with a circle around a center, and since all vertices on the circle have degree of 3, it is all odd for every $n$, There is no Euler circuit for a wheel.
\item[(d)] $Q_n$ This is a cube in $n$ dimension, so each vertex are connected with $n$ vertices, so when $n$ is even but $n \neq 0$, it has Euler circuit.
\end{enumerate}
